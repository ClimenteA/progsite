## Appointments
Here the clients can make an appointment for the span of current day up to 2 weeks. If they need to create an appointment after 2 week they can click the green button and can be contacted later. That's because if and appoinment is not in the near future then there is a high probability people won't show up.

When an user clicks on a hour interval he will need to fill this small contact form.

Then you or an employee can see the scheduled appointments in Appointments page. You can Validate the apointment by calling the user and confirming, you can call the client and reschedule or cancel the appointment.

In the Not scheduled tab you will see appointments that need to be done in the future (over 2 weeks from now).
